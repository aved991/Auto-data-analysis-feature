# Auto-data-analysis-feature
Data sets used for checking the code/algorithm : bjson files, students_data.csv, databases.sqlite


A feature or a tool that can be used written in python code 
This project is created on October 2024. 
So the programming languages used will be those which available on "October 2024"
Type of file format the program will be able to detect: csv, sql dump, excel, tsv, txt, json, bson



Workflow of this project:
-Data Format detection: csv, tsv, xlsx, xls, txt, bson, sql, sqlite
-Reading & displaying the data contents 
-Performing exploratory Data Analysis
-Checking whether data preprocessing is required or applicable
      -if required then continue
      -if unapplicable then ignore and skip
-Data preprocessing
-Application of Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms: 
      -checking whether algorithms are applicable
      -displaying the output if algorithms are applicable
-Generic feedback: Descriptions & visualizations


Features to be added:
-Identification, reading or conversion(into CSV) of XML files
-Identification, reading or conversion(into CSV) of JSON files
